How to Build the Deltacloud Website
===================================


Requirements
------------

You need to have Ruby version 1.8 installed, along with the following gems:

* webby
* haml
* rdiscount

Depending on your distribution, you may need to add the directory with `webby`
executable to your $PATH.


Building the Website
--------------------

Deltacloud website is created using [Webby][1]. It takes a website defined by a
set of layouts, templates and content files, runs a count of filters on them
and produces a static web structure that can be directly posted to a webserver
or displayed in a browser.

[1]: http://webby.rubyforge.org/

To do this, go to the `site` directory and run `webby`:

    $ cd path/to/deltacloud/site/
    $ webby

The website will be generated in the `site/output/` directory. To
view it, you can point your browser to that directory.

    file:///path/to/docs/deltacloud.org/output/

In addition, Webby comes with a little webserver that can make it easier. If
you run:

    $ webby autobuild

The website will be opened in your browser and it will automatically rebuild
itself any time you change its sources.

Deploying the site
------------------

After you are finished with your changes, check them into subversion
(including generated stuff in site/output/)

Then, log on to people.apache.org and

  cd /www/incubator.apache.org/deltacloud/
  svn update

It will take some time for the mirroring process to pick up your changes,
but they should eventually show up at

  http://incubator.apache.org/deltacloud/index.html

Note that the API docs for the Ruby client in output/ruby-client/doc are
not automatically generated. If they need to be updated, they need to be
copied over from client/doc/ manually and checked in.

File Structure
--------------

site/
    - the Deltacloud website

site/content/
    - the pages that are displayed on the website

site/layouts/
    - the structure of the website -- including logo, navigation,
      footers, etc.

site/output/
    - the final version of the site -- this is what you want to view in a
      web browser.

site/misc/
    - sources for someof the images on the site
